Your encrypted app data (stripped of personal identifiers such as name and email, and associated only with a random code) will be sent to secure data servers used for the GlucoSuccess research study that are maintained by Sage Bionetworks (<a href="http://sagebase.org">http://sagebase.org</a>). </p>
<p>This study gives you the option to share your data in 2 ways. Your choice will not affect your ability to participate in the GlucoSuccess study. <br />
    <br />
  <strong>1- Share</strong><strong> broadly with qualified researchers</strong>: After this study is completed,  other researchers who are not part of the original study may request access to the coded study data (already stripped of personal identifiers such as your name or email), so that it can be analyzed in a new way to benefit medical research, or help guide development of future apps. Those requesting data must agree to use the data for research purposes responsibly and ethically, and in accordance with applicable regulations. Qualified researchers must agree to not attempt to re-identify any individuals. Criteria for qualified researchers and data sharing requests will be reviewed by a group of GlucoSuccess study investigators and representatives of Sage Bionetworks. Sage Bionetworks will have no oversight over future research conducted with coded study data. <br />
    <br />
  <strong>2- Share with the GlucoSuccess team </strong><strong>and its partners </strong><strong>only: </strong>You can choose to share your study data <u>only</u> with the GlucoSuccess team and its partners. If you choose this option, your encrypted app data will be accessible only to the GlucoSuccess team and its research partners, and will not be made available to other researchers. <br />
    <br />
  The results of this research study may be presented at research conferences or in publications. If the results of this study are made public, only coded study data will be used (that is, your personal information will not be disclosed). Results will never be published in a way that would allow data to be associated with individual users. </p>
You can change the data sharing setting through the app preferences at any time.
