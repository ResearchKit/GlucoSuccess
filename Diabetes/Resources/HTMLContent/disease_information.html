   <p>Living with type 2 diabetes is a challenge because of the many things patients are asked to do: take new medications, measure their blood sugar, lose weight, increase their activity level, and eat a healthy diet. If left unchecked, type 2 diabetes can have serious long-term complications, including:</p>
   		<ul style="padding-left:30px;">
            <li>Heart attacks</li>
            <li>Strokes</li>
            <li>Kidney disease</li>
            <li>Vision problems (or even blindness)</li>
            <li>Pain or loss of feeling in the hands and feet</li>
            <li>The need to have fingers, toes, or other body parts removed (amputated) because of infections or poor blood circulation</li>
       	</ul>     
            
        
            
       <p>The best way to decrease the chance of developing these complications is keeping your blood sugar within the target range.  The key steps to achieving this goal are:</p>
			<ol style="padding-left:20px;">
                <li><boldie>Watching your diet carefully.</boldie>Your body breaks down food into carbohydrate, protein, and fat.  Eating excessive amounts of carbohydrates can increase your blood sugar levels.  Common foods high in carbohydrates include: bread, pasta, rice, fruits, dairy, and desserts or other sweets.  It can be challenging to know the carbohydrate content of the food you’re eating. One of the goals of this app is to provide an easy, seamless way to monitor your diet and carbohydrates.</li><li><boldie>Exercise.</boldie>Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, and these benefits may be even greater for patients with diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends moderate exercise for approximately 150 minutes per week total (e.g., one way to achieve this is to exercise five times per week for thirty minutes each time).  By keeping your iPhone with you, this study will also help you track your activity level and see how it helps you control you blood sugar.</li>
                <li><boldie>Weight loss.</boldie> This can be achieved by increasing your exercise, eating less (and more healthily), or both.</li>
                <li><boldie>Medication.</boldie> Your doctor may start you on either an oral diabetes medication (to be taken by mouth) or an injectable medication such as insulin. This app will help you keep track of whether you have taken all of your diabetes medicines each day.</li>
                <li><boldie>Monitoring of blood glucose.</boldie> For some people with type 2 diabetes, your physician will recommend checking your blood glucose at home. This is an important way to keep track of how well you are managing your diabetes. This app will provide an easy way for you to track your blood glucose. More importantly, the app will tie everything together and show you how your diet, exercise, and medicines are affecting your blood glucose.  </li>
           </ol>
