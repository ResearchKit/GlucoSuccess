<p>GlucoSuccess helps you keep track of health behaviors important for people with type 2 diabetes, such as physical activity, diet, and taking your medicines. Data that you share through the app as part of the research study will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and glucose values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers understand how health behaviors influence blood glucose in real life, with a resolution greater than ever before. (Traditionally, these studies are done by asking people to fill out very long questionnaires on paper every few years.) </p>
<p>At the same time, GlucoSuccess analyzes your data to provide personalized insights into how your diet and physical activity relate to your finger-stick blood glucose values, and helps you manage your type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>By combining a personal app and a research study, GlucoSuccess will help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research. </p>
