<p>Study investigators will analyze coded app data from everyone who agrees to participate in the GlucoSuccess study, but they will be unable to connect it back to any individual user. </p>
<p>The results of this research may be published in a scientific or medical research journal so that others can learn from this study. Results will never be published in a way that would allow data to be associated with individual users. </p>
<p>After this study is completed,  other researchers may request access to the coded study data (already stripped of personal identifiers), so that it can be analyzed in a new way to benefit medical research. Those requesting data must agree to use the data responsibly and in accordance with applicable regulations; these data requests will be reviewed by a group of study investigators and representatives of Sage Bionetworks.</p>
<p>Other researchers who are granted access to coded study data will not be able to connect the data back to study participants.</p>
<p>Study data will never be sold to any third party. </p>
